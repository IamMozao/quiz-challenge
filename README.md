# Quick note to the evaluator

This project was designed as an exhibition of my skills as a front-end developer. Therefore, you may find the solutions, the used libraries, or even simple pieces of code that can look like 'overkill' for such a simple project. If that happens, keep in mind that it was only done to demonstrate my abilities and skills with the used technologies, trying to fit the main ones in this application. In real-life cases, the complexity of the applied solutions may differ.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
